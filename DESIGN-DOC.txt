Section 3: "Physical interface"

	The layout of the interface is as follows:

	.------------------------.
	| .  .                   |
	| |  |   o o o o o o o o |
	| |  |   o o o o o o o o |
	| |  |   o o o o o o o o |
	| Q  Q   l l l l l l l l |
	| |  |   l l l l l l l l |
	| |  | b l l l l l l l l |
	| |  | b l l l l l l l l |
	| '  ' b l l l l l l l l |
	'------------------------'

	Key:
		Q -- Slide potentiometer
		o -- Standalone LED
		l -- Buttons (with LED)
		b -- Buttons (without LED)

Section 4: "Slice Mode elements"

	.------------------------.
	| .  .                   |
	| |  |   o o o o o o o o |
	| |  |   O O O O O O O O |

	'------------------------'

	Key:
		o - LEDs: show active beat as (floor(beat / (longest / 8)) + 1)
		O - LEDs: show active beat as (beat % 8)
		0 - LEDs: lit if corresponding column in seq-view contains active sequences
		X - Slide potentiometer 1
		Y - Slide potentiometer 2
		p - PAGE button
			-> Toggle between page 1 and 2.
		v - VIEW button
			-> Toggle between viewing single-button seqs and the slicing canvas.
		t - THROW button
			-> Same toggle effect as VIEW, but only when held down.
			-> t+s+s: The seq represented by the first s-button will be thrown into the row of the slicing canvas represented by the second s-button.
			-> t+p+v: MIDI PANIC: Send note-offs for every MIDI note on every MIDI channel.
		s - SEQ/SLICE buttons
			-> In seq view:
				>> When seq is inactive: Start playing seq within its first subsection, aligned with global active subsection.
				>> When seq is active: Transfer seq's activity to within its first subsection.
			-> In slice view:
				>> When seq is inactive: Start playing seq within the selected subsection, aligned with global active subsection.
				>> When seq is active: Transfer seq's activity to within the selected subsection.
		a - OFF button (OFF command)
			-> a+s: Toggle the sequence off, and clear its temporary modifications.
			-> a+n+s: Toggle the sequence off, but keep its temporary modifications.
		b - CUE-1 button
			-> When chorded with OFF or SEQ, delay said command until the next beat is reached.
		c - CUE-8 button
			-> When chorded with OFF or SEQ, delay said command until the next beat of value (beat % 8 = 1) is reached.
		d - SKIP button
			-> d+s: In slice view: Skip/enable various subsections of the seq. Skipped sections will not be played.
		e - PITCH button
			-> f+s: In slice view: Change sequence's pitch offset.
				>> Format: 0(negative or positive) 0000000(pitch)
		f - SNAP button
			-> g+s: In slice view: Snap seq's notes to scale, on top of seq's PITCH modifications.
				>> Format: 0000(scale rotation) 0000(scale type)
		g - SCATTER button
			-> g+s: In slice view: Scatter the timing of a sequence's notes, in a manner that varies on every loop.
				>> Format: 0000(chance) 00(left dist) 00(right dist)
		h - WANDER button
			-> h+s: In slice view: Cause a sequece to have a chance of directional wandering when its activity enters a new subsection.
				>> Format: 00000(chance) 0(up) 0(left) 0(down)
