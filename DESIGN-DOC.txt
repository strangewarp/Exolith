Section I-3: "Physical interface & UI commands"

	This section details the Serpentarium as a physical unit: labels for hardware elements, and descriptions of key-commands.

	Subsection I-3-a: "Physical interface"

		The layout of the interface is as follows:

		.------------------------.

		Key:
			Q -- Slide potentiometer

		Key:
			X - Slide potentiometer 1
			Y - Slide potentiometer 2
			p - PAGE button
				-> Toggle between page 1 and 2.
			v - VIEW button
				-> Toggle between viewing single-button seqs and the slicing canvas.
			t - THROW button
				-> Same toggle effect as VIEW, but only when held down.
				-> t+s+s: The seq represented by the first s-button will be thrown into the row of the slicing canvas represented by the second s-button.
				-> t+p+v: MIDI PANIC: Send note-offs for every MIDI note on every MIDI channel.
			s - SEQ/SLICE buttons
				-> In seq view:
					>> When seq is inactive: Start playing seq within its first subsection, aligned with global active subsection.
					>> When seq is active: Transfer seq's activity to within its first subsection.
				-> In slice view:
					>> When seq is inactive: Start playing seq within the selected subsection, aligned with global active subsection.
					>> When seq is active: Transfer seq's activity to within the selected subsection.
			a - OFF button (OFF command)
				-> a+s: Toggle the sequence off, and clear its temporary modifications.
				-> a+n+s: Toggle the sequence off, but keep its temporary modifications.
			b - CUE-1 button
				-> When chorded with OFF or SEQ, delay said command until the next beat is reached.
			c - CUE-8 button
				-> When chorded with OFF or SEQ, delay said command until the next beat of value (beat % 8 = 1) is reached.
			d - SKIP button
				-> d+s: In slice view: Skip/enable various subsections of the seq. Skipped sections will not be played.
			e - PITCH button
				-> f+s: In slice view: Change sequence's pitch offset.
					>> Format: 0(negative or positive) 0000000(pitch)
			f - SNAP button
				-> g+s: In slice view: Snap seq's notes to scale, on top of seq's PITCH modifications.
					>> Format: 0000(scale rotation) 0000(scale type)
			g - SCATTER button
				-> g+s: In slice view: Scatter the timing of a sequence's notes, in a manner that varies on every loop.
					>> Format: 0000(chance) 00(left dist) 00(right dist)
			h - WANDER button
				-> h+s: In slice view: Cause a sequece to have a chance of directional wandering when its activity enters a new subsection.
					>> Format: 00000(chance) 0(up) 0(left) 0(down)
			o - LEDs: show active beat as (floor(beat / (longest / 8)) + 1)
			O - LEDs: show active beat as (beat % 8)
			0 - LEDs: lit if corresponding column contains active sequences
