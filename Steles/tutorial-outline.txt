
Tutorial Outline
(AKA: things that would need to be explained in a tutorial for Tine)

	HARDWARE:

		SD CARD
			* Do not remove or insert SD-card while Tine is powered on: this may cause data corruption

	
	
	GLOBAL COMMANDS:

		GESTURES



	PLAY MODE:

		ON

		OFF

		CUE

		SHIFT

		SLICE

		CUED SLICE-INSERTION

		CUE-OFF

		PAGE-OFF

		SCATTER
			* Is always unset for the most-recently-touched seq when toggling into RECORD MODE

		SCATTER UNSET

		PAGE SCATTER UNSET

		GLOBAL PLAY/STOP

		TOGGLE RECORD-MODE
			* The most-recently-touched sequence is the one that will be selected for editing. This does not apply to any sequence-buttons pressed while holding the topmost ("PAGE") control-button for any of its associated commands.



	RECORD MODE:


		ARM RECORDING
			* When this button is held, the top LED-row will display the binary value of the sequence that is currently being recorded into


		BPM


		BPM CHANGE


		CHAN
			* While recording notes via MIDI-IN, you must set CHANNEL to match the MIDI channel you wish to record


		HUMANIZE
			* A random velocity amount, from 0 to the HUMANIZE value, will be subtracted from every VELOCITY as it's recorded


		SHIFT RECORDING POSITION
			* Distinct from the version of SHIFT in PLAY MODE

		HOW TO UPDATE FIRMWARE:
			1. IMPORTANT! Unplug Tine's DC-power cable, turning Tine off. Do not plug this cable back in until after all of these steps are complete!
			2. Remove the SD-card.
			3. Unscrew the six screws on Tine's faceplate.
			4. Remove Tine's faceplate, and its left-side-plate.
			5. On the body of your AVR-programming-cable, set its power-switch to "Power Target" mode.
			6. Connect AVR-programming-cable to the 6-pin shrouded header on the left side of the bottom-board. It should slide in without any forcing.
			7. Connect other end of AVR-programming-cable to your computer's USB port. This should turn Tine back on; it is now being powered by your computer.
			8. Open up the Arduino program on your computer.
			9. Select in the menu: File -> Open...
			10. Navigate to the firmware's main file and select it. (For Steles, the default firmware, this file is "Steles.ino".)
			11. Select in the menu: Tools -> Board -> Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila
			12. Select in the menu: Tools -> Processor -> ATmega328
			13. Select in the menu: Tools -> Programmer -> [Whichever type of AVR-programming-cable you are using]
			14. Select in the menu: Sketch -> Upload Using Programmer
			15. The firmware-uploading process will now display its status in a console window. Do not disturb Tine, your computer, or your AVR-programming-cable until both the "Writing" and "Reading" processes have finished, and a message appears that says "avrdude done. Thank you."
			16. Unplug AVR-programming-cable from your computer's USB port.
			17. Unplug AVR-programming-cable from Tine.
			18. Reassemble Tine's left-side-plate and its faceplate.
			19. Screw the faceplate back on.
			20. Re-insert the SD-card.
			21. Congratulations: you have updated your Tine unit's firmware! You may now plug the DC-power cable back in.
