Software:

	. test basic UI functionality
		. test toggling into RECORD MODE
			-- make RECORD TOGGLE's glyph more visible when its buttons are simply held
		. test all GUI menus in RECORD MODE
		. test all user-controlled var-setting operations in RECORD MODE
	. test basic recording
		. test note-playing on grid-keyboard
		. test REPEAT button
		. test note-recording itself
	. test basic sequencing
	. test sustain system
	. test "toggle to next/prev sequence" in RECORD mode
	. test REPEAT commands
	. test MIDI CC commands
	. test file-load
	. test MIDI-IN (notes)
		. uncomment parseRawMidi() in void loop()
	. test MIDI-IN (clock)
		. add a "DO NOT SEND CLOCK SIGNALS" user-flag to the CLOCK MASTER/FOLLOW mechanism
	. add PROGRAM CHANGE functionality (in addition to CONTROL CHANGE)
	. add GUI prompts for:
		. current RECORDSEQ value (RECORD MODE)
	. check whether sequences are allowed to have non-multiple-of-2 lengths
	. add SONG POSITION POINTER functionality while in CLOCK FOLLOW mode, to orient the global cue-position correctly?

Hardware:

	. test MIDI-IO LED circuit with 0.1uF & 1uF capacitors
		. or with 1k/10k resistor from cap+ to GND
		. if it's as bright as the current kind, then: change KiCad schematics & PCBs & Mouser order to reflect this
	. update KiCad file:
		. use regular-sized capacitors, in a laying-down position, because people replacing capacitors wouldn't have special tiny ones
			. reroute traces based on this
			. update Mouser cart to reflect this
		. update R-SET resistor's value based on the new diffused LEDs
	. move AVR-ISP programming header as close to the back of the unit as possible, to not interfere with new diffused-LED design
