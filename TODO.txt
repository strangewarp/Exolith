Tegne TODO

Software:

	. change second LED-row to display the current number of active sustains
	-- done afaict, but still needs additional fixes to underlying sustain & note-press systems before being testable
	. display both pages' sequence-activity simultaneously
	-- done afaict, but still needs fixes to the sequencing system before being testable
	. display SCATTER status only when a SCATTER command is held
	. timing system / global cue system look broken? fix them
	. test basic recording
		. test note-playing on grid-keyboard
		. test REPEAT button
		. test note-recording itself
	. test basic sequencing
	. test sustain system
		. test sustain-display row
	. test all cue-commands
		. OFF
		. CUE
		. SLICE
		. CUE (with SLICE insertion)
		. CUE OFF
		. PAGE OFF
		. SCATTER (amount)
		. SCATTER UNSET
		. PAGE SCATTER UNSET
		. GLOBAL PLAY/STOP
	. test "toggle to next/prev sequence" in RECORD mode
	. test REPEAT commands
	. test MIDI CC commands
	. test file-load
	. test MIDI-IN (notes)
		. uncomment parseRawMidi() in void loop()
	. test MIDI-IN (clock)
		. add a "DO NOT SEND CLOCK SIGNALS" user-flag to the CLOCK MASTER/FOLLOW mechanism
	. replace bloated LedControl with optimized custom functions
	. survey all TO_UPDATE calls, for superfluous flags
	. add PROGRAM CHANGE functionality (in addition to CONTROL CHANGE)
	. add GUI prompts for:
		. current RECORDSEQ value (RECORD MODE)
	. check whether sequences can actually function with non-multiple-of-2 lengths
	. add SONG POSITION POINTER functionality while in CLOCK FOLLOW mode, to orient the global cue-position correctly?
	. add a command to shift the position of the global cue-point?
	. replace LedControl with LedControl_HW_SPI???
	. remove "THIS CODE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING" from license-statement
	. test overloading the 8-events-per-tick system
	. test overloading the SUSTAIN system
	. test overloading the MIDI-IN system
	. soak-test the physical prototype

Hardware:

	. test breadboarded prototype with shared-SPI-line layout (and two digital SPI-select pins), for LedControl_HW_SPI lag-reduction
		. if this works:
			. reroute PCB prototype to reflect the changes
			. update both KiCad and firmware to reflect the changes
			. two pins will be freed up by this, so reassign them:
				. pin 1: digital MIDI-IN indicator (NOTEs only)
				. pin 2: digital MIDI-OUT indicator (NOTEs only)
			. if 2 pins are indeed freed-up for MIDI I/O indicators, then only two slots of the 74HC14N Schmitt-trigger will end up being used, so look for a smaller 2-slot alternative to it
			. put the results of this line of inquiry into the "update KiCad file" task
	. consider using 32x 2-color LEDs, instead of 64x 1-color LEDs, because that may actually fit the UI better
		. note: each color within these LEDs needs to have the same voltage/current requirements, so as to play nice with the MAX7219 chip
		. if this is viable, change the "update KiCad file: top-board" task to: "replace LEDs with 2-color LEDs"
	. test higher resistor values for POWER-LED to get a matching brightness level
	. note: this task may no longer be necessary, but keeping it until I'm sure:
		. test MIDI-IO LED circuit with 0.1uF & 1uF capacitors
			. or with 1k/10k resistor from cap+ to GND
			. if it's as bright as the current kind, then: change KiCad schematics & PCBs & Mouser order to reflect this
	. update KiCad file:
		. reduce thermal-plate size to accomodate new smaller heatsinks
		. bottom-board:
			. use regular-sized capacitors, in a laying-down position, because people replacing capacitors wouldn't have special tiny ones sitting around
			. update R-SET resistor's value based on the new diffused LEDs
			. move POWER-LED to center of bottom-board, and use a high-brightness white LED with a very wide visibility-cone
		. top-board:
			. update all LED positioning & LED formats(?)
			. reduce button-spacing by 1mm, both vertical and horizontal
		. both boards:
			. move shrouded AVR-ISP jack to edge of bottom-board, to prevent any need to muck around with safety-caps
				. make a cut through edge of top-board, so AVR-ISP header can be accessed more easily when faceplate is removed
			. reduce boards' size, to fit the results of various changes
			. make sure there's still enough room for all M3 screws & standoffs
				. move POWER port to right side?
			. change all edge-cuts to reflect the rearrangement of ports
			. double-check that ports aren't competing for space with standoffs
	. look into rubber adhesive nubs, for protecting the screws on the underside, & preventing any scratching/wear of surfaces
